This is the repository for your final project. It is up to you to decide how to structure your files and directories. The final result will be a website created using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).

You can see the rendered example site [here](https://uc-cfss.github.io/fp-template/).
